# Environment

To make sure everything in this folder will function well. A new virtual environment should be created using the "environment.yml" specification file. After modifying the first and last line of the file, which specify the name of the environment and the storage location, the following command should be executed. Codes have been tested on this environment (with Python version: 3.11.9).

`conda env create -f environment.yml`
